Develop a web application for Human Resources management that allows companies to store and manage their employee information in a PostgreSQL database. The application will feature a multi-tenancy architecture, enabling multiple companies to operate independently within the same application.

Requirements
Database Schema

Use PostgreSQL with the following schema:
Company Table: Stores company details.
Employee Table: Stores employee details linked to a specific company.
Employment Table: Links employee data to employment details.
Ensure all tables support UUIDs for unique identification.
Frontend Development

Use React with react-hook-form for form management.
Implement a step-by-step form interface with a progress bar:
Utilize the provided base code structure to create a navigation component.
Separate input fields into logical sections for better user experience.
Data Submission

On form submission, validate and store employee data in the PostgreSQL database.
Implement error handling for form submission failures.
Contract Generation

After successful data submission, query the database for relevant information.
Generate a downloadable employment contract based on a DOCX template.
Multi-Tenancy Architecture Considerations
Database Design:

Use foreign keys to associate employee and employment data with the correct company.
Ensure all queries are filtered by company_id to maintain data isolation.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication to restrict access to company data.
Ensure that users can only access their own company's data.
Scalability:

Plan for future scalability by considering the addition of features like analytics, reporting, and user role management.
Performance:

Optimize database queries and indexing strategies to ensure quick data retrieval.
Development Plan
Set up the PostgreSQL database and tables.
Create the React frontend using create-react-app.
Implement the step-by-step form using react-hook-form.
Develop the backend API to handle data storage and retrieval.
Integrate the document generation functionality using a library like docx.
Test the application for usability and performance.
Tools and Libraries
